	<h3>Bootcamp 2021: Fun with circles </h3> 
	<p> 
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2021).This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the use of arrays, loops, and randomness. 
	I created bouncing circles by creating a loop at the beginning of the code to create multiple of circles. Since I put random in the code where I would control the sizes of the circle,all of their sizes are different and they are able to bounce off the walls.If certain keys are pressed and held on (E,R,T) different colours are produced.For example holding on the key 'T' will make them  turn yellow then once you let go off the key the balls will be pink. If the key '1' is pressed the sizes will increase whilst pressing 0 will decrease the sizes of the circle.

<h3> Java Project 2022: Zombie apocalpse </h3> 
<p> 
In this Java project, I made a zombie game using Intellij. The aim of the game is to find collect the gun and get all of the coins to be able to have access to open the door to go to a new level.The difficulty of the levels increases as new zombies would be introduced that has more lives. There is a special zombie that can't be killed and is an obstacle to make the game alot more harder.
